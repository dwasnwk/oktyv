# Oktyv Project DNA
# Version: 0.1.0-alpha.1
# Created: 2026-01-22
# Philosophy: Option B Perfection - Do It Right First Time

identity:
  name: "Oktyv"
  tagline: "Browser automation MCP server for career platform integration"
  purpose: |
    Connects Career System to external job platforms through browser automation.
    Enables seamless data extraction from LinkedIn, Indeed, Wellfound via MCP.
  philosophy: |
    Foundation Out - Build backend infrastructure before surface features.
    Zero Technical Debt - No mocks, stubs, or temporary solutions.
    Cognitive Monopoly - Context and intelligence as competitive advantage.
    Lean Infrastructure - Use existing tools, build only what's unique.

boundaries:
  does:
    - "Browser automation via Puppeteer"
    - "LinkedIn job search and extraction"
    - "Indeed job search (future)"
    - "Session persistence (stays logged in)"
    - "Rate limiting per platform"
    - "Canonical job data schema"

    - "Manage job applications"
    - "Track application status"
    - "Provide AI analysis"
    - "Replace Career System"

interfaces:
  - workspace: "Career System"
    relationship: "Data provider"
    connection: "MCP protocol via Claude Desktop"
    data_flow: "Oktyv → Claude → Career System"
    
  - workspace: "KERNL"
    relationship: "Development tooling"
    connection: "Session management, file operations"
    data_flow: "KERNL manages Oktyv development"

key_decisions:
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Standalone MCP server, not KERNL plugin"
    rationale: |
      - Single responsibility (browser automation only)
      - Easier to test in isolation
      - Large Puppeteer dependencies (~300MB)
      - Usable beyond Career System
      - Simpler deployment and versioning
      
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Puppeteer over Playwright"
    rationale: |
      - Simpler API for MCP use case
      - Smaller footprint
      - Better Node.js integration
      - Sufficient for LinkedIn/Indeed
      - Can migrate if multi-browser needed
      
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Cookie-based session persistence"
    rationale: |
      - User stays logged in across invocations
      - No credential management needed
      - Mirrors real browser behavior
      - Respects platform security
      
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    decision: "Platform-agnostic canonical data schema"
    rationale: |
      - Career System independent of LinkedIn specifics
      - Easy to add new platforms
      - Consistent Claude experience
      - Future-proof design

naming:
  etymology: |
    "Oktyv" combines "oct" (eight, suggesting completeness) with modern tech aesthetic.
    Represents eight-fold path: discover, filter, extract, analyze, apply, track, follow-up, succeed.
